\section{Introduction}

Your introduction goes here! Some examples of commonly used commands and features are listed below, to help you get started.

\section{Some \LaTeX{} Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

\subsection{Sections}

Use \texttt{section}s and \texttt{subsection}s to organize your document. \LaTeX{} handles all the formatting and numbering automatically. Use \texttt{ref} and \texttt{label} for cross-references --- this is Section~\ref{sec:examples}, for example.

\subsection{Tables and Figures}

Use \texttt{tabular} for basic tables --- see Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example. You can upload a figure (JPEG, PNG or PDF) using the files menu. To include it in your document, use the \texttt{includegraphics} command (see the comment below in the source code).

% Commands to include a figure:
%\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{your-figure's-file-name}
%\caption{\label{fig:your-figure}Caption goes here.}
%\end{figure}

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|r}
Item & Quantity \\\hline
Widgets & 42 \\
Gadgets & 13
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:widgets}An example table.}
\end{table}

\subsection{Mathematics}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
$$S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i$$
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

\subsection{Lists}

You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

\begin{enumerate}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{enumerate}
\dots or bullet points \dots
\begin{itemize}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
